### How to import project in NetBeans ####
~~1. In NetBeans, File -> Open projects... and select the project folder~~  
~~2. Execute ant target task `gfp`, either using command-line `ant gfp`, or using NetBeans (in the projects windows, right click on build.xml -> Run Target -> Other Targets -> gfp)~~

The project now uses Gradle and can be executed directly.
